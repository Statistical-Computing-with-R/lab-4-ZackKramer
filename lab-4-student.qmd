## The Data

In this lab we're going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in
California. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).

The data come to us from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

**0. Load the appropriate libraries and the data.**

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
#| label: load-data

childcare_costs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')

counties <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/counties.csv')
```

**1. Briefly describe the dataset (~ 4 sentences). What information does it contain?**

The Childcare Costs dataset provides information on the median weekly prices for childcare across various age groups in California from 2008 to 2018. It includes features such as the study year, age group (infant, toddler, preschool), county, and the median cost of care for each age category. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information related to the counties, such as median household income.  

## California Childcare Costs

Let's start by focusing only on California. 

**2. Create a `ca_childcare` dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the `childcare_costs` dataset.** 
*Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.*

```{r}
#| label: ca-childcare-costs

ca_childcare <- counties |>
  filter(state_name == "California") |>
  inner_join(childcare_costs,
             by = join_by(county_fips_code == county_fips_code))

```

**3. Using a function from the `forcats` package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the [10 Census regions](https://census.ca.gov/regions/) in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.**  
*Hint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!*

```{r}
#| label: recoding-county-to-census-regions

ca_childcare <- ca_childcare |> 
  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, " County"),
         region = fct_collapse(.f = county_name,
                               "Superior California" = c("Butte", "Colusa", "El Dorado", "Glenn", "Lassen", "Modoc", "Nevada", "Placer", "Plumas", "Sacramento", "Shasta", "Sierra", "Siskiyou", "Sutter", "Tehama", "Yolo", "Yuba"),
                               "North Coast" = c("Del Norte", "Humboldt", "Lake", "Mendocino", "Napa", "Sonoma", "Trinity"), 
                               "San Francisco Bay Area" = c("Alameda", "Contra Costa", "Marin", "San Francisco", "San Mateo", "Santa Clara", "Solano"), 
                               "Northern San Joaquin Valley" = c("Alpine", "Amador", "Calaveras", "Madera", "Mariposa", "Merced", "Mono", "San Joaquin", "Stanislaus", "Tuolumne"), 
                               "Central Coast" = c("Monterey", "San Benito", "San Luis Obispo", "Santa Barbara", "Santa Cruz", "Ventura"),
                               "Southern San Joaquin Valley" = c("Fresno", "Inyo", "Kern", "Kings", "Tulare"),
                               "Inland Empire" = c("Riverside", "San Bernardino"), 
                               "Los Angeles County" = c("Los Angeles"), 
                               "Orange County" = c("Orange"),
                               "San Diego - Imperial" = c("Imperial", "San Diego")))
  

```


**4. Let's consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the `median` of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the `region` and the `study_year`. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.**

```{r}
#| label: median-income-by-region-over-time

ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarize(mmhi_2018 = median(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = region,
              names_from = study_year,
              values_from = mmhi_2018,
              names_prefix = "mhi_") |>
  arrange(desc(mhi_2018))

```


**5. Which California `region` had the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this `region` correspond to the `region` with the lowest `median` income in 2018 that you found in Q4?**  
*Hint: The code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.*

```{r}
#| label: lowest-median-weekly-price-2018

ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year == 2018) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(mmc_infant = median(mc_infant)) |>
  arrange(desc(mmc_infant)) |>
  slice_tail(n = 1) |>
  select(region)

```

For 2018, the region with the lowest 'median' full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants was Superior California. This is different than the region with the lowest 'median' income, which was North Coast. 

**6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.**

  mutate(age_group = recode(age_group, 
                            mc_infant = "Infant", 
                            mc_toddler = "Toddler",

                                            .y = mc_all))) +

                                "Preschool"))) +

  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(100, 500))


```


## Median Household Income vs. Childcare Costs for Infants

**7. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) and the full-time median weekly price charged for center-based childcare for an infant in California. Overlay a linear regression line (lm) to show the trend.**

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot-median-income-vs-childcare-cost

ggplot(data = ca_childcare, mapping = aes(x = mhi_2018,
                                          y = mc_infant)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(x = "Median Household Income (2018 $)", 
       y = "",
       title = "Median Weekly Price for Center-Based Childcare for an Infant ($)") + 
  theme_bw()


```

**8. Look up the documentation for `lm()` and fit a linear regression model to the relationship shown in your plot above.**

```{r}
# complete the code provided
reg_mod1 <- lm(data = ca_childcare, formula = mhi_2018 ~ mc_infant)
summary(reg_mod1)
```

**9. Using the output from `summary()`, write out the estimated regression line (recall: $y = mx + b$).**

y = 283.37x - 14669.86


**10. Do you have evidence to conclude there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California? Cite values from your `summary()` output to support your claim!**

Yes. The coefficient for mc_infant is 283.37, with a highly significant p-value (< 2e-16), indicating that increases in childcare costs are associated with increases in income. The model accounts for 63.5% of the variability in median household income (R-squared = 0.635), and the overall model is statistically significant (F-statistic = 1106, p < 2.2e-16). This supports the conclusion that higher childcare costs are linked to higher household incomes.
